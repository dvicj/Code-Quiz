        <h1>JavaScript Code Quiz!</h1>
        <span>Welcome to my code quiz! You will have a total of 2 minutes (120 seconds) to answer 
            10 questions on JavaScript fundamentals. Every wrong answer will deduct 10 
            seconds from the clock. Once you have answered all of the questions - or run out of time -
            the quiz will be finished and you will be able to submit your score. 
            Have fun!
